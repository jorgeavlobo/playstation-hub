# Console status

**Document status:** Initial specification — source research, not live validated  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-11-05  
**Implementation:** Not started  
**Primary proposed Python module:** `custom_components/playstation_hub/transport/state.py`

## 1. Objective and scope

Normalize LAN console observations into reliable state.

## 2. Source-confirmed upstream behavior

The upstream parser maps HTTP-like response code 620 to STANDBY and other response codes to AWAKE; this is an upstream heuristic, not a comprehensive status specification. Discovery responses include host metadata and can be stale.

## 3. PlayStation Hub architecture decision

Model AWAKE, STANDBY, OFFLINE/UNREACHABLE and UNKNOWN separately. Store observed_at UTC and freshness; never turn an unknown response into proof of AWAKE. Preserve last-known state separately from current availability.

## 4. Proposed interface contract

The module must expose typed, async-compatible operations and return normalized domain objects or explicit typed errors. Transport I/O must not block the Home Assistant event loop. No Home Assistant entity or frontend component may perform protocol I/O directly. Each observation must record its source and UTC timestamp. Details of function signatures remain **to be specified**, not implemented.

## 5. Failure, privacy and lifecycle policy

All network operations need bounded timeouts and cancellation-safe cleanup. Invalid or stale data must never be reported as confirmed current state. Secrets must not enter logs, diagnostics or frontend assets. The integration must unload cleanly and handle multiple consoles without shared mutable protocol state.

## 7. Open questions and implementation-stage verification

- [ ] Finalize precise wire-format details and edge cases from the upstream source.
- [ ] Review licenses and any Sony service restrictions before reuse.
- [ ] Specify Python data models, error types and async lifecycle.
- [ ] Add synthetic positive/negative protocol fixtures and tests.
- [ ] Validate behavior on a test PS5 during implementation.
- [ ] Record firmware compatibility and recovery behavior.
